# This script is a wrapper around the the 'make install' command for the
# TSS source code. This is a workaround for a travis-ci quirk that causes
# any command run under 'sudo' to be unable to run clang. This script fixes
# up the borked PATH, moves to the directory where we built the TSS and then
# runs 'make install'
# see: https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-ci/issues/3088
